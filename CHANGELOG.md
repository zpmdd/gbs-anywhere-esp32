# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Split the experimental ESP32-S3 firmware from gbs-anywhere PR18 into a
  separately maintained companion repository, preserving source attribution
  and the AGPL-3.0-or-later license.
- Check local ports 80 and 8089 before activation; a custom desktop port adds
  another check. Refuse activation on an open port or an unknown check result
  before opening USB.
- Document private Docker settings/pairing exports and the need to save the
  La Marzocco integration in the desktop app before migrating.
- Add port-ownership and saved-integration regression tests plus ESP-IDF CI.
- Clarify precursor real-cup results and the portable build's pending hardware
  validation. No hardware-validated firmware release is published yet.
